# Introduction-to-Computer-Systems-CSCI-3240

Welcome to my Introduction to Computer System repository

In this repository you can explore my most recent projects I worked on in Computer Systems class.

Project 1 - I was tasked with writing a C program that takes a single command-line argument and produces the same output as the xxd program with the same argument. The xxd command in Linux creates a hex dump of a given file or standard input.

Project 2 - I was tasked with chance to reverse engineer a set of five mystery functions from disassembled machine code (Assembly Language)
